# GeoGH

A proof-of-concept Python script that will autogenerate random text and commit it to a git repo. It will continue to do this in random intervals (which can be configured) until stopped.

Why do this? For fun, either for the joy of coding it, or to have fun with those who look at raw metrics as a way to measure software development. Run it for your own reasons :)
